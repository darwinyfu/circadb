  %h2 About CIRCA
  %p
    Circadian rhythms drive daily oscillations in many different physiologies, including
    blood pressure, body temperature and behavior. In addition, disruptions of the circadian
    clock contribute to the pathologies of metabolic disorders as well as cardiovascular
    disease and cancer. Our lab is interested in the mechanism by which circadian
    oscillations drive these processes. We are using microarray analysis in combination with
    curve-fitting and Fourier-transform based statistical algorithms to search the genome
    for transcripts which oscillate under circadian control. We have identified more than
    3000 cycling genes in the liver and smaller subsets of rhythmic genes in the pituitary
    and fibroblasts. We are currently expanding our initial studies to identify rhythmic
    transcripts in over 15 different tissue types including the heart, kidneys and brain.
    These data sets will be mined using bioinformatic techniques to discover novel circadian
    regulatory elements, characterize components of the circadian clock, and identify
    regulatory genes responsible for the physiologies and pathologies associated with
    circadian rhythms.
