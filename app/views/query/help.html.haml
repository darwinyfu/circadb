  %h2 CIRCA Help
  %p
    Welcome on the CIRCA help page. Here we give you an example that shows the usage of the CIRCA application.
  %h3 Querying CircaDB
  %p
    In this example we want to find out if <em> Per3</em>
    is cyclic. The first step is to enter the gene name into the search
    box. Next we can adjust the probability filter. The default is set on
    the JTK P-value. Together with the probability cut-off value this
    filter looks for JTK P-values beneath the cut-off. If we are only
    interested in significant JTK P-values of 0.01 and lower we can
    set the probability cut-off value on 0.01. With the last filter
    method a specific tissue can be chosen. Once the sheet is filled
    out the search can be begin.
  %p== For more query options, see the #{  link_to("Advanced Query Help", advanced_query_help_path()) }
  %h3 Understanding the plot
  %p
    As result we will see a plot, where the X-axis is the time in
    hours and the Y-axis reflects the expression levels measured
    on the individual gene chips. The background shaded areas represent the cycle of light and dark conditions based on CT times.
  %h3 Understanding the values
  %p
    There are three different algorithms to statistically test if a dataset
    is cyclic or not. More information about these algorithm can be found
    in the #{link_to("About", about_path())} tab.
  %p
    %b Note:
    %i For all the algorithms we tested cyclic behaviour for a range of different periods, except for the DeLichtenberg were we only looked for a period of 24 hours.
