    Welcome to the CIRCA help page. Here you will find all the information
    you need for a succesful search.

    %a(name="querying") Querying CircaDB
  %p
    In this example we want to find out if <em> Per3</em>
    is cyclic. The first step is to enter the gene name into the search
    box. Next we can adjust the probability filter. The default is set on
    the JTK P-value. Together with the probability cut-off value this
    filter looks for JTK P-values beneath the cut-off. If we are only
    interested in significant JTK P-values of 0.01 and lower we can
    set the probability cut-off value on 0.01. With the last filter
    method a specific tissue can be chosen. Once the sheet is filled
    out the search can be begin.
  %p
    There are two mode of querying CircaDB:
    %a(href="#simple") Simple
    and
    %a(href="#advanced") Advanced.
  %h3
    %a(name="simple") Simple Query Mode
  %p
    This is the default. Simply enter a set of terms and the engine will query for
    each term seperately, then join all of the results from each separate term together
    into the final result. In other words a query for <code>kinase inhibitor</code>
    will return all entries with the word <code>kinase</code> together with any entry
    that has <code>inhibitor</code> in their respective annotations.
  %p
    This is usually not what one would want returned from such a query. This is where
    the advanced query mode comes in.

  %h3
    %a(name="advanced") Advanced Query Mode
  %p
    Once the "advanced query mode" checkbox has been selected, the query strings
    are no longer simply split into individual queries. As the saying goes "with
    great power comes great responsibility". In a nutshell, you must now use the
    underlying Sphinx search engine's
    %a(href="http://sphinxsearch.com/docs/2.0.5/extended-syntax.html") extended syntax query mode.


  %p
    Briefly, the default behavior of the query <code>kinase inhibitor</code> would bring
    back all entries that match both <code>kinase <b> AND </b> inhibitor</code>.
    Instead of an implicit <code>OR</code> between terms, there is now an implicit
    <code>AND</code> between terms.
  %p
    To bring back the <code>OR</code> behavior you would need to separate terms
    with a <code>|</code> (a vertical bar, or "pipe") character. E.g.
    <code> kinase | inhibitor</code>.
  %p
    To bring back the specific phrase "kinase inhibitor", you would need to
    surround both words with quotes. E.g. <code>"kinase inhibitor"</code>
  %h4 More examples
  %p
    %em Query for the exact phrase "kinase inhibitor" that also make mention of "mitochondrial"
    %br
    %code "kinase inhibitor" mitochondrial
  %p
    %em Query for kinases, but not any entry with "inhibitor" in the record
    %br
    %code kinase !inhibitor

    Sphinx is a large a powerful system. You can review all of the various
    ways to use the extended syntax at the
    %a(href="http://sphinxsearch.com/docs/2.0.4/extended-syntax.html") Sphinx extended query syntax help page

  %h4 CircaDB Query Fields
  %p
    Having read the above, you may be wondering what fields you can use to query CircaDB. The annotation is straight from   the Affymetrix annotation files. We have pulled out certain columns from that file and indexed them as follows:

  %table
    %tr
      %th Field
      %th Description
    %tr
      %td probeset_name
      %td The Affymetrix probeset name
    %tr
      %td transcript_id
      %td The transcript ID
    %tr
      %td representative_public_id
      %td
    %tr
      %td unigene_id
      %td Unigene ID
    %tr
      %td gene_symbol
      %td NCBI gene symbol
    %tr
      %td gene_title
      %td Full gene title
    %tr
      %td entrez_gene
      %td The Entrez gene ID
    %tr
      %td swissprot
      %td The SwisProt accession
    %tr
      %td refseq_protein_id
      %td The RefSeq protein accession
    %tr
      %td refseq_transcript_id
      %td The RefSeq NA sequence accession
    %tr
      %td target_description
      %td The description from the Affymetrix annotation file

  %h2
    %a(name="results") Understanding the results
  %h3
    %a(name="plot") Understanding the plots
  %p
    As result we will see a plot, where the X-axis is the time in
    hours and the Y-axis reflects the expression levels measured
    on the individual gene chips. The background shaded areas represent the cycle of light and dark conditions based on CT times.
  %h3
    %a(name="values") Understanding the values
  %p
    There are three different algorithms to statistically test if a dataset
    is cyclic or not. More information about these algorithms can be found
    in the #{link_to("About", about_path())} tab.
  %p
    %b Note:
    %i For all the algorithms we tested cyclic behaviour for a range of different periods, except for the DeLichtenberg were we only looked for a period of 24 hours.
